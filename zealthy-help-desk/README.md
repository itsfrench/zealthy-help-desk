## Zealthy Help Desk - Take-Home Exercise

The coding exercise is to create a basic “help desk” / support system ticket management
system.


On the main page of the app, end users of the service should be able to submit support ticket
requests. Necessary fields include name, email and a description of the problem they are
experiencing.


On a separate page, the backend admin panel, support staff should be able to see a list
summary of each ticket, including status. They should be able to drill down into the ticket and
respond to a request, as well as update the status of the ticket. Possible statuses are “new”, “in
progress”, and “resolved”.


It is preferred that the front-end UI is implemented using React, with the backend implemented
in a language/framework of your choosing.


Please deploy your completed exercise to the web somewhere (using Vercel or similar) and
include the demo URL when submitting your solution.


Note: For sake of time, the app does not need to send email. Please output via logging instead,
“Would normally send email here with body: ...”


You should attempt to complete this in less than 5 hours of dedicated time and submit the
completed exercise as a github repo URL to Kyle (kyle@getzealthy.com), Brie,
(brie@getzealthy.com) and Shanti (shantibraford@gmail.com). You may complete this in one or
more sittings, and should do so within a few days of receiving the exercise prompt.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
